# Product Context: King of the Amazons

## Why This Project Exists
This project is a university assignment for a computational introduction course designed to teach students:
- C++ programming language fundamentals
- Software engineering principles through practical implementation
- Game development concepts including state management and user interfaces
- Artificial Intelligence algorithms for game playing
- Competitive programming through Botzone platform participation

## Problem Statement
Students need to demonstrate mastery of C++ programming by implementing a complete game system that includes:
1. **Complex Game Logic**: The Game of Amazons has non-trivial rules requiring careful state management
2. **User Interaction**: Both human-vs-human and human-vs-computer gameplay modes
3. **AI Development**: Implementation of computer opponent using game theory algorithms
4. **Data Persistence**: Save/load functionality for game states
5. **Competitive Integration**: Botzone platform compatibility for tournament participation

## Target Users
1. **Primary**: Course teaching assistants (for grading and review)
2. **Secondary**: Fellow students (for demonstration and learning)
3. **Tertiary**: Botzone platform (for automated tournament play)

## User Experience Goals
### For Teaching Assistants (Grading)
- Easy to compile and run with minimal setup
- Clear menu system for accessing all required features
- Intuitive controls for testing game functionality
- Comprehensive error handling and edge case management
- Well-documented code and project structure

### For Students (Learning)
- Demonstrates clean C++ code organization
- Shows effective use of object-oriented design patterns
- Provides example of game AI implementation
- Serves as reference for similar projects

### For Botzone Platform
- Standard input/output interface for move communication
- Efficient move generation and game state evaluation
- Competitive performance against other bots

## Success Metrics
1. **Academic**: Score ≥ 8.5/10 on review grading
2. **Technical**: All basic functionality working without crashes
3. **Competitive**: Bot performs competitively in Botzone tournaments
4. **Educational**: Code serves as learning example for C++ and game development

## Constraints and Considerations
### Academic Constraints
- Must adhere to course requirements and deadlines
- Must include comprehensive project report
- Must pass multiple review sessions with teaching assistants

### Technical Constraints
- Must be implemented in C++
- Must work on standard university lab machines
- Must interface with Botzone platform specifications
- Should be efficient enough for AI decision-making within time limits

### Pedagogical Considerations
- Code should demonstrate good software engineering practices
- Implementation should be understandable to fellow students
- Architecture should support incremental development and testing

## Value Proposition
This project provides:
1. **Educational Value**: Hands-on learning of C++ and software engineering
2. **Practical Value**: Complete game implementation with real-world constraints
3. **Competitive Value**: Participation in programming competitions
4. **Portfolio Value**: Demonstratable project for academic and career purposes
