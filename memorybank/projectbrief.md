# Project Brief: King of the Amazons

## Overview
This project is a C++ implementation of the "Game of the Amazons" (also known as "Amazons" or "Queen's Game"), a two-player abstract strategy board game. The project serves as a university assignment for a computational introduction course, with specific requirements outlined in the course documentation.

## Core Requirements
1. **Basic Game Functionality** (6 points total)
   - Menu system (new game, load game, save game, exit)
   - Board and piece display (can be character-based or graphical)
   - Complete game flow from start to finish with ability to stop mid-game
   - Save/load functionality for game states

2. **AI Capability** (1 point)
   - Implementation of computer opponent using game AI algorithms
   - Documentation of AI approach and algorithms in project report

3. **Special Features** (1.5 points)
   - User-friendly interface and ease of use
   - Aesthetic presentation and interface design
   - Feature completeness and integration
   - Additional innovative features

4. **Botzone Competition** (1.5 points)
   - Participation in online bot tournaments through Botzone platform
   - Three test matches and one formal competition

## Project Goals
- Learn and apply C++ programming concepts
- Implement game logic and state management
- Develop AI algorithms for game playing
- Create user-friendly interface (CLI or GUI)
- Participate in competitive programming through Botzone

## Success Criteria
- Meet all basic functionality requirements
- Implement working AI opponent
- Score well in Botzone competitions
- Create comprehensive project documentation
- Pass multiple验收 (review) sessions with teaching assistants

## Constraints
- Language: C++
- Platform: Cross-platform (Windows/Linux/macOS)
- Timeline: Multiple验收 deadlines (Dec 30, Jan 9, Jan 10)
- Botzone competition deadlines (Dec 20, Dec 27, Jan 3, Jan 10)

## Key Deliverables
1. Complete C++ game implementation
2. Project report/documentation
3. Botzone competition submissions
4. Code repository with version control
