Hello everyone, I will be conducting the evaluation for your Introduction to Computing course project. This group is used to track evaluation progress and release notifications. Please pay attention to the following:

1. The total score for this assignment is 10 points, with evaluation accounting for 8.5 points and Botzone competition accounting for 1.5 points.

2. Below is the scoring criteria for the evaluation part (may differ from other teaching assistants):

2.1 Basic Functions - 6 points:
    - (10 points) Menu (selection, new game, save game, load game, exit)
    - (10 points) Board and pieces (can be implemented with characters or using a graphical board)
    - (25 points) Gameplay (able to implement a complete game from start to finish, with the ability to stop midway)
    - (15 points) Save board and load game functionality (having this functionality is sufficient, trigger timing and method can be customized)
    Final score = total of the above 4 parts / 10.

2.2 AI Capability - 1 point:
    - In your report, explain the implementation algorithm of your game AI. The teaching assistant will ask questions during evaluation by reading the report, and give a comprehensive score.
    - Note: The teaching assistant is not concerned with the actual capability of your AI (this will be tested by the Botzone competition; I'm more concerned with what efforts you've made and what implementation ideas you have)
    - The score range for this part is [0.5, 1], rounded to 1 decimal place.

2.3 Special Features - 1.5 points:
    - I will focus on the following aspects of your project:
        (1) User-friendliness: Whether it's easy for humans to use.
        (2) Interface aesthetics.
        (3) Function completeness: Whether basic functions are well integrated (e.g., the completeness of save/load functionality)
        (4) Other special features:
            - For example, can meet some other user needs.
            - If any, explain in the report.
        Note: Graphical interface is not required, but if implemented, there will be some bonus points.
    - The score range for this part is [0.8, 1.5], rounded to 1 decimal place.

2.4 If the basic function score does not reach 3.5 points, the scores for the latter two parts will be 0.

3. Each student has 3 evaluation opportunities. Please attend evaluations during the corresponding time periods:

    3.1 First evaluation period: From today until (December 30, 23:59)
        This evaluation will include preliminary scoring. Students who complete early can participate.
        The teaching assistant will read your reports and code. Running issues and modification suggestions will be provided within 48 hours.

    3.2 Second evaluation period: From today until (January 9, 23:59)
        This evaluation will include systematic scoring, and the score can be used as your final score.
        Please send your report and code to the teaching assistant 1 day before evaluation and confirm the evaluation time.
        If unsatisfied with this score, you can proceed to the next evaluation based on the teaching assistant's feedback.

    3.3 Third evaluation period: From today until (January 10, 23:59)
        Submit final report and code on-site, directly enter Q&A and scoring session.
        The teaching assistant will give your final score.
        Students who have already been evaluated before can choose to use their previous evaluation score as the final score.

4. About the report:
    To help the teaching assistant better understand your project, please submit a report during evaluation. It doesn't have to be the final version but must include the following:
    - How to run your program? (Requirement: The teaching assistant should be able to start the program for testing by reading the report)
    - How you implemented your AI.
    - What you consider special features in your project.

5. About evaluation:
    First evaluation has no Q&A session, only communication via WeChat.
    Second and third evaluations: Conducted online via Tencent Meeting, evaluation time not exceeding 15 minutes.
    Evaluation process: 1. Demonstrate program usage, complete a game/save/load; 2. Free Q&A (mainly based on running conditions, and testing your understanding of your implemented AI algorithms)

6. Also, please note the Botzone test/formal competition submission deadlines:
    First test competition: December 20, 2025 (Saturday) 23:59
    Second test competition: December 27, 2025 (Saturday) 23:59
    Third test competition: January 3, 2026 (Saturday) 23:59
    Formal competition: January 10, 2026 (Saturday) 23:59
