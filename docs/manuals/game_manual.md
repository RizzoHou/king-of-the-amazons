## Game Rules

### Overview
The Game of Amazons is a two-player abstract strategy game played on a 10×10 board. Each player controls 4 Amazons (queen-like pieces). The goal is to control more territory than your opponent by limiting their movement options.

### Board Layout
- **Size**: 10×10 grid
- **Coordinates**: Rows (0-9) and columns (0-9)
- **Starting Positions**:
  - **Black Amazons (B)**: (0,3), (0,6), (3,0), (3,9)
  - **White Amazons (W)**: (6,0), (6,9), (9,3), (9,6)

### Turn Structure
Each turn consists of **two parts**:
1. **Amazon Move**: Move one of your Amazons like a chess queen (any distance in 8 directions)
2. **Arrow Shot**: From the new position, shoot an arrow like a chess queen (any distance, 8 directions)

### Movement Rules
1. **Amazon Movement**:
   - Move like a queen in chess (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal)
   - Any distance as long as the path is clear
   - Cannot land on occupied squares (other Amazons or arrows)

2. **Arrow Shooting**:
   - Must shoot from the Amazon's new position
   - Same movement rules as Amazon movement
   - Arrow becomes a permanent obstacle on the board
   - Cannot shoot through occupied squares

3. **Restrictions**:
   - Cannot move through or land on occupied squares
   - Cannot shoot through occupied squares
   - Arrow must land on an empty square

### Winning Conditions
- The game ends when a player cannot make a legal move
- The **winner** is the player with more **territory** (reachable squares)
- If both players have equal territory, the game is a draw

### Territory Calculation
- **Territory**: All squares reachable by a player's Amazons
- **Reachable**: Squares that can be reached through queen-like movement
- **Blocked**: Squares occupied by Amazons, arrows, or outside the board

## User Interface Guide

### Dual Interface Modes
King of the Amazons now supports two interface modes:

1. **Graphical Mode (Default)**: Modern graphical interface with mouse interaction
2. **Text Mode**: Traditional console interface with keyboard input

**Running Different Modes**:
```bash
# Graphical mode (default)
./build/amazons

# Text mode (console interface)
./build/amazons --text

# Graphical mode explicitly
./build/amazons --graphical
```

### Error Handling
The game provides helpful error messages:

| Error Type | Example Message | Solution |
|------------|-----------------|----------|
| Invalid Format | `Invalid move format: expected 6 numbers` | Use correct format: `from_row from_col to_row to_col arrow_row arrow_col` (6 numbers) |
| Illegal Move | `Invalid move: Move is not legal in current position.` | Check if path is clear and positions are valid |
| Save Error | `Failed to save game.` | Check write permissions in `data/saves/` directory |
| Load Error | `Failed to load game.` | Save file may be corrupted or missing |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Build Errors
**Problem**: CMake or make fails
**Solutions**:
- Ensure CMake ≥ 3.16 is installed
- Check C++ compiler compatibility
- Clean build directory and rebuild: `rm -rf build && mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make`

#### 2. Runtime Errors
**Problem**: Game crashes or doesn't start
**Solutions**:
- Verify all dependencies are installed
- Check `data/saves/` directory exists and is writable
- Run with debug: `./build/amazons 2>&1 | tee error.log`

#### 3. Input Issues
**Problem**: Moves not accepted
**Solutions**:
- Use exact format: `from_row from_col to_row to_col arrow_row arrow_col` (6 numbers)
- Ensure coordinates are within 0-9 range
- Check that path is not blocked by arrows or other Amazons

#### 4. Save/Load Problems
**Problem**: Cannot save or load games
**Solutions**:
- Check `data/saves/` directory permissions
- Ensure enough disk space
- Verify JSON files are not manually edited/corrupted

### Performance Tips
- **AI Games**: AI vs AI mode may be slow with many moves
- **Large Games**: Games with many arrows may have slower move generation
- **Memory**: Undo history is stored in memory

## Game Strategy Tips

### Basic Strategy
1. **Control Center**: Central squares are more valuable
2. **Mobility**: Keep your Amazons mobile
3. **Blocking**: Use arrows to limit opponent's movement
4. **Territory**: Think in terms of reachable squares

### Opening Principles
1. **Develop Amazons**: Move Amazons to active positions
2. **Control Space**: Use arrows to claim territory
3. **Maintain Options**: Keep multiple movement paths open
4. **Watch Corners**: Corners can trap Amazons

### Common Tactics
1. **Arrow Placement**: Place arrows to create barriers
2. **Fork Threats**: Position Amazons to threaten multiple areas
3. **Sacrifice**: Sometimes sacrificing mobility gains territory
4. **Endgame**: Count reachable squares carefully

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: What is the Game of Amazons?
**A**: It's an abstract strategy game invented in 1988 by Walter Zamkauskas. It combines elements of chess (queen movement) with territory control.

### Q: How is the winner determined?
**A**: The player with more reachable squares (territory) when no legal moves remain wins.

### Q: Can I play against a friend on the same computer?
**A**: Yes! Use "Human vs Human" mode for local two-player gameplay.

### Q: How good is the AI?
**A**: The Phase 2 AI uses a greedy algorithm with mobility heuristic. It's competent but not expert-level. Advanced AI algorithms are planned for Phase 3.

### Q: Can I save mid-game and continue later?
**A**: Yes! Use the save/load system from the main menu.

### Q: What happens if I enter an invalid move?
**A**: The game will show an error message and prompt you to try again.

### Q: Is there a time limit for moves?
**A**: No, you can take as long as you need for each move.

### Q: Can I undo multiple moves?
**A**: Currently, only the last move can be undone.

### Q: What happens when I type 'exit' during gameplay?
**A**: The game will ask for confirmation and then return to the main menu. Your game progress is preserved and you can save it from the main menu or continue playing later.
