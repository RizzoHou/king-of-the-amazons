according the response from the instructor, the paths in the last three lines of CMakeLists.txt are incorrect. the right ones should be as followed due to his response:
```
add_executable(test_botzone tests/integration/test_botzont.cpp)
target_link_libraries(test_botzone game_components)
target_include_directories(test_botzone PRIVATE ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include)
```
you can double-check whether the problem reported trully exists before taking further action.
