# Problem p008.md - RESOLVED

**Original Problem**: i think the color of the newly added buttons(choose side, black or white in ai vs human mode) seems ugly. the colors should be in harmony with the overall color arrangement of our gui.

**Additional Feedback**:
1. The font color of "Play as White" should be changed to black or other color to make it more clear with a light background color.
2. Remove the "move first" and "move second" on the button since it seems insignificant.

**Status**:  RESOLVED (Jan 7, 2026)

**Solution**: Updated side selection button colors to harmonize with the overall GUI color scheme and addressed additional feedback.

**Implementation Details**:

1. **Color Analysis**: Analyzed existing GUI color palette:
   - Main menu background: Dark blue-gray (`44,62,80`)
   - Board colors: Light blue-gray (`232,235,239`) and slate blue (`125,135,150`)
   - Main menu buttons: Orange (`230,126,34`), Blue (`52,152,219`), Green (`46,204,113`), Purple (`155,89,182`)
   - Save button: Green (`39,174,96`)

2. **Color Harmonization**:
   - **"Play as Black"**: Changed from pure black (`40,40,40`) to dark slate blue (`90,100,120`) - harmonizes with board dark squares
   - **"Play as White"**: Changed from pure white (`245,245,245`) to light blue-gray (`210,220,230`) - harmonizes with board light squares
   - **"Back" button**: Kept existing purple (`155,89,182`) which already matches the "Load Game" button

3. **Additional Improvements**:
   - **Font Color**: Changed "Play as White" button text color from white to dark gray (`50,50,50`) for better contrast with light background
   - **Button Text**: Removed "(Move First)" and "(Move Second)" text from buttons - now simply "Play as Black" and "Play as White"
   - **Code Updates**: Modified `drawButton()` lambda to accept optional text color parameter and updated button text

4. **Code Changes**: Modified `src/ui/GraphicalController.cpp` in the `drawSideSelection()` function:
   - Updated `drawButton()` calls with new harmonized colors and text colors
   - Added text color parameter to `drawButton()` lambda for better contrast control
   - Simplified button text to remove redundant information
   - Added comments explaining color choices and their relationship to the overall GUI

**Key Improvements**:
-  Side selection buttons now harmonize with the overall GUI color scheme
-  "Play as Black" button uses dark slate blue that matches board dark squares
-  "Play as White" button uses light blue-gray that matches board light squares
-  "Play as White" button text uses dark gray (`50,50,50`) for better contrast with light background
-  Button text simplified: "Play as Black" and "Play as White" (removed "(Move First)" and "(Move Second)")
-  Colors maintain conceptual connection to "black" and "white" while fitting the aesthetic
-  All existing functionality preserved
-  Compilation successful, all 30 unit tests pass

**Files Modified**:
- `src/ui/GraphicalController.cpp` - Updated button colors, text colors, and button text in `drawSideSelection()` function

**Build Status**: Compiles successfully, all tests pass
