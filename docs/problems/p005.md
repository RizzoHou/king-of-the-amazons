the human player is always set to be the black side. the game should allow the human player to choose which side he wants to be. some details:
1. in the human vs human mode, the function mentioned above should not be implemented since both sides are operated by humans and people can choose whether they want to be the first or the second to move freely.
2. in the ai vs human mode, the function mentioned above should be added. because the current game only allow ai be the white side, you should be careful about the communication protocol differences when you want to implement the mode where ai can be the black side. you can read docs/wiki for more information about the communication protocol. and maybe you can write a test script to test if the communication will work when the ai is set to be white side.
