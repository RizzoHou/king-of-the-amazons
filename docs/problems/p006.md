if i want to undo my previous operation in the ai vs human mode, i need to press U 2 times since single pressing on U only makes the board state to get back to the state where ai is going to make his own movement. what i want is when i press the U only 1 time in the my turn of ai vs human, the board state will get back to the one where i haven't make my movement in the my previous operation.
